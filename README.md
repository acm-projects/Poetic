# Poetic
This web app seeks to unite a community of both aspiring and seasoned poets to collaboratively work on a poem together.

# MVP
- Create an algorithm to match at least 2 users together to write a poem based on their poem writing styles, genres, and tones
- Create a tool that allows at least 2 users to work together on a poem concurrently. 
  - One user writes a few lines, then they can give a turn to the next user to write a few lines.
- Create a system for "liking" poems.

# Stretch Goals
- Have a "popular" / "trending" page for poems that are liked or being read a lot by users.
- Create a system where pictures can be added or generated for every line of a poem, like a comic book
- Create a commenting system where users can give line-by-line feedback on others' poems
